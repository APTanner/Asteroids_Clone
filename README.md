## Features
### Object Pooling 
- Removes constant reallocation of memory from instantiating and destroying gameobjects constantly
- In place for the bullets, asteroids, and particle effects

### Asteroids
- Procedurally generated line mesh
- Custom shader that shows 'heating' on the asteroids depending on projectile impact point
- The shader also represents asteroid health by gradually shifting its color from white to red
